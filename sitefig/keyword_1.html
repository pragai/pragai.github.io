<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Machine learning involves computers discovering how they can perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do
  so. It involves computers learning from data provided so that they carry out certain tasks. For simple tasks assigned
  to computers, it is possible to program algorithms telling the machine how to execute all steps required to solve the
  problem at hand; on the computer's part, no learning is needed. For more advanced tasks, it can be challenging for a
  human to manually create the needed algorithms. In practice, it can turn out to be more effective to help the machine
  develop its own algorithm, rather than having human programmers specify every needed step.[6]</p>
<p>The discipline of machine learning employs various approaches to teach computers to accomplish tasks where no fully
  satisfactory algorithm is available. In cases where vast numbers of potential answers exist, one approach is to label
  some of the correct answers as valid. This can then be used as training data for the computer to improve the
  algorithm(s) it uses to determine correct answers. For example, to train a system for the task of digital character
  recognition, the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits has often been used.[6]</p>
<h3>Machine learning approaches</h3>
<p>Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the
  "signal" or "feedback" available to the learning system:
  Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher",
  and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.
  Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its
  input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end
  (feature learning).
  Reinforcement learning: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain
  goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program
  is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize.[3]
<p>Other approaches have been developed which don't fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation, and sometimes more
  than one is used by the same machine learning system. For example topic modeling, dimensionality reduction or meta
  learning.[7]</p>

<p>As of 2020, deep learning has become the dominant approach for much ongoing work in the field of machine
  learning.[6]</p>
<h3>History and relationships to other fields</h3>
<p>See also: Timeline of machine learning</p>

<p>The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an American IBMer and pioneer in the field of computer
  gaming and artificial intelligence.[8][9] A representative book of the machine learning research during the 1960s was
  the Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.[10] Interest
  related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973.[11] In 1981 a report
  was given on using teaching strategies so that a neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10
  digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.[12]</p>

<p>Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning
  field: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance
  measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."[13] This definition of the
  tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the
  field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", in
  which the question "Can machines think?" is replaced with the question "Can machines do what we (as thinking entities)
  can do?".[14]</p>
<h3>Artificial intelligence</h3>
<p>As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence. In the early days of AI
  as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to
  approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what was then termed "neural networks"; these were
  mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of
  statistics.[17] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.[18]:488</p>

<p>However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine
  learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and
  representation.[18]:488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.[19] Work on
  symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming, but the more
  statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information
  retrieval.[18]:708â€“710; 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same
  time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as "connectionism", by researchers from other disciplines
  including Hopfield, Rumelhart and Hinton. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of
  backpropagation.[18]:25</p>

<p>Machine learning (ML), reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal
  from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from
  the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and
  probability theory.[19]</p>

<p>As of 2020, many sources continue to assert that machine learning remains a subfield of AI.[20][21][22] The main
  disagreement is whether all of ML is part of AI, as this would mean that anyone using ML could claim they are using
  AI. Others have the view that not all of ML is part of AI[23][24][25] where only an 'intelligent' subset of ML is part
  of AI.[26]</p>

<p>The question to what is the difference between ML and AI is answered by Judea Pearl in The Book of Why.[27]
  Accordingly ML learns and predicts based on passive observations, whereas AI implies an agent interacting with the
  environment to learn and take actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.[30]</p>
<h3>Data mining</h3>
<p>Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning
  focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery
  of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data
  mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs
  data mining methods as "unsupervised learning" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the
  confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML
  PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is
  usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data
  mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge,
  an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD
  task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.</p>
