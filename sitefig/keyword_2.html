  <title>A. A. Milne: At The Zoo</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>At The Zoo</h3>
There are lions and roaring tigers,</br>
and enormous camels and things,</br>
There are biffalo-buffalo-bisons,</br>
and a great big bear with wings.</br>
There's a sort of a tiny potamus,</br>
and a tiny nosserus too -</br>
But I gave buns to the elephant</br>
when I went down to the Zoo!</br>
</br>
  There are badgers and bidgers and bodgers,</br>
and a Super-in-tendent's House,</br>
There are masses of goats, and a Polar,</br>
and different kinds of mouse,</br>
And I think there's a sort of a something</br>
which is called a wallaboo -</br>
But I gave buns to the elephant</br>
when I went down to the Zoo!</br>
</br>
If you try to talk to the bison,</br>
he never quite understands;</br>
You can't shake hands with a mingo -</br>
he doesn't like shaking hands.</br>
And lions and roaring tigers</br>
hate saying, "How do you do?" -</br>
But I give buns to the elephant</br>
when I go down to the Zoo!
